# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This is a learning environment. Everyone is here to grow.
We are committed to making this a welcoming space for everyone
regardless of experience level, background, or identity.

## Expected Behavior

- Be kind and respectful in code review comments
- Give constructive feedback — focus on the code, not the person
- Ask questions freely — there are no stupid questions
- Celebrate each other's progress

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Copying another student's solutions and submitting as your own
- Editing or deleting another student's files
- Dismissive or rude feedback in code reviews

## Review Guidelines for Students

When reviewing a peer's PR, frame feedback as:
- "Have you considered...?"
- "I think this might be clearer if..."
- "Great approach! One thing to note..."

## Violations

Violations should be reported to the instructor by opening a
private GitHub Issue labeled `conduct`.
